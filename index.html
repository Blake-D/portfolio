                <b>Web Oscillator</b> is an online synthesizer written in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, using <b>Web Audio API</b>'s oscillator node. Clicking on the grid produces a drone that changes pitch with the cursor's location. The user can select the waveform type (sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth) and can apply harmonies to the drone. There is also a 2D mode in which two drones are produced, one of which changes with the cursor's X-axis movement, the other with Y-axis movement, allowing the user to produce a wide variety of harmonies.

            <b>Rickipedia & Mortiverse</b> is a full-stack web application where users can browse character, episode, and location information from the tv show <b>Rick & Morty</b>. Users can also create user accounts which enables them to post and discuss theories about the show.<br></br><br></br>
            I worked on Rickipedia & Mortiverse as part of a group project while studying at <b>General Assembly</b>. We built the front end in <b>React</b> and the back end in <b>Express</b>, which calls on a <b>MongoDB</b> database. My particular role in the project was building and seeding the database, making sure the front and back ends talked to each other, and rendering data from API calls to their respective routes.

                <b>Showdown on Cygnus 8</b> is a single-page browser game written in Javascript, HTML, & CSS. The user is challenged to a series of quickdraw matches in which, pending a countdown, they must keep their gun holstered by hovering the mouse cursor over a designated area on the screen. If the cursor is removed from the holster before the countdown's end, the countdown stops. Once the count reaches zero, the player must click on the enemy combatants before they can fire.
